          <p>When it comes to construction fatalities, trench deaths can be easy to overlook. The number of deaths – 49 in the 2016 to 2017 time period – falls far below the top four culprits of construction deaths: falls, electrocution, struck by object and caught-in/between.</p>
          <p>But trench fatalities usually mean prolonged efforts to recover a victim, exacerbating the experience for co-workers and family. They require advanced expertise by first responders. Many times, even partially buried victims don’t survive. And they deal a staggering loss to families and to crews that sometimes have worked together for years.</p>
          <p>Then there’s the cost. OSHA fines are just the beginning. A trench death stops work, increases workers’ compensation costs, hikes your insurance premiums and makes you ineligible to work for certain owners. And all of that is before the legal fees.<br>
          Most frustrating of all: every death could have been prevented by using methods that have been known for decades.</p>
          <p>In preparing this report, the editors of Equipment World wanted to examine the human side of the trench fatality statistics. We talked to survivors, co-workers, victims’ families and first responders. We heard from victims’ advocates and lawyers. We asked trench protection experts and contractors for best practices.</p>
          <p>These deaths delivered immeasurable loss. They all began with the decision that a trench didn’t require worker protection.</p>
